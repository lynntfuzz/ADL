This website is for a realtor in Southern California. It hooks up to the CRMLS (California Regional Multiple Listing Service) through an iFrame provided by the CRMLS and accessible because of our client's MLS subscription. A live version of the website is accessible here: (https://mighty-wildwood-77166.herokuapp.com/)

## Admin Page and Content Management System
The admin page is accessible from /admin. From there you can view the contacts who have entered their contact information and a list of searches sent to the CRMLS iFrame. A user login is required for accessing the admin page. Please contact (email:lynntfuzz@gmail.com) for access.

After you log in to the Admin page, you can return to the Home page and edit the content (text and images) in the "Showcase" section in the middle of the web page.
